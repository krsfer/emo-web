## Core Features Mapping

### Android â†’ Web Equivalents

| Android Feature | Web Implementation | Technology |
|----------------|-------------------|------------|
| **Pattern Canvas** | HTML5 Canvas + React | Canvas API + Bootstrap Grid |
| **Emoji Palettes** | Horizontal Scrolling Cards | Bootstrap Carousel + CSS Grid |
| **Voice Commands** | Web Speech API + AI Processing | Web Speech API + Claude |
| **Pattern Storage** | PostgreSQL + IndexedDB | Railway PostgreSQL + PWA |
| **AI Integration** | Server-side Claude API | Next.js API Routes |
| **Accessibility** | Screen Reader + Voice Navigation | WCAG 2.1 AA + ARIA |
| **Printing** | Web Print API + PDF.js | Browser Print + jsPDF |
| **Multi-language** | next-i18next | Built-in i18n support |

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Accessibility First
- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance**: All components meet accessibility standards
- **Screen Reader Optimized**: Semantic markup with proper ARIA labels
- **Voice Navigation**: Complete hands-free operation capability
- **Motor Disability Support**: Large touch targets, simplified gestures
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full functionality without mouse/touch

### 2. Progressive Enhancement
- **Core Functionality**: Works without JavaScript for basic pattern viewing
- **Enhanced Experience**: Rich interactions with JavaScript enabled
- **Offline Capability**: PWA features for pattern creation without internet
- **Adaptive Performance**: Degrades gracefully on slower devices

### 3. Mobile-First Design
- **Touch Optimized**: Gesture-based emoji selection and pattern manipulation
- **Responsive Breakpoints**: Seamless experience across all screen sizes
- **Performance Focused**: Optimized for mobile data usage and battery life
- **PWA Features**: Install to home screen, offline functionality

### 4. API-Driven Architecture
- **Microservices Pattern**: Separate APIs for patterns, AI, voice, and management
- **Cacheable Responses**: Optimized for performance and reduced API costs
- **Fallback Systems**: Graceful degradation when external services fail
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse while maintaining usability

## Performance Targets

### Core Metrics
